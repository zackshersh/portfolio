# Zack's Temporary Portfolio

This is a temporary portfolio site I created to apply for internships for the Summer of 2022.
---
This portfolio site organizes both my creative and web development projects and seperates them through a tagging system allowing users to view creative or web based items in addition to a number of other parameters such as video, graphic, group project, etc...
