# Portfolio Site

This is my portfolio site created to host both my recent front-end and full-stack development projects, and an archive of my old creative projects.

## Dependencies

This site was built in **React.js**, and uses **React Router** for page routing.

## Design

<div>
  <img width="300" alt="portfolio-1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78242020/207156631-4650113b-7317-4d2b-854a-b703e6422c56.png">
  <img width="300" alt="portfolio-2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78242020/207156663-2e151cb9-5dac-419f-b09b-3968974d8856.png">
</div>

All work and personal information is hosted in a single page which uses css' grid layout to structure the page. Each project is represented by an icon which when clicked on does not move, but hides all other project icons and reveals that projects' content which is laid out on the same grid.

## Live Version
